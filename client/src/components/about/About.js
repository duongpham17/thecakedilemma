            Hi! I’m Emma, just a girl who loves to bake. I’ve been baking since 9 years old when my mum got me a kids baking set for Christmas. 
           I didn’t even have an electric whisk so my older brother had to do all the heavy whisking, yes, he even hand-whisked meringues! 
           <br/><br/>
           Since then, baking has always been such a huge part of my life, a way to be creative and experiment with different flavours and techniques. 
           I launched The Cake Dilemma to hopefully kickstart a career that I am truly passionate about and I hope you enjoy my bakes as much as I love making them for you! 
           <br/><br/>
           If you have any questions, suggestions or opinions to share with me, please don’t hesitate to get in contact via WhatsApp, email, Instagram DM or Facebook Messenger. 
           <br/><br/>
           With Love,
           <br/><br/>
